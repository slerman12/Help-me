Hi Michael, 

Was this six-month review mentioned at/between the time of my termination and October 31st?

Hi Sam —

I’m not sure which review you’re referring to: the one you skipped in Fall 2022, the unsuccessful one in Spring 2023, or the make-up review that you didn’t schedule.  The requirement for reviews is documented in the CS PhD Student Handbook.  Deadlines for reviews are communicated to all PhD students and advisors via email every year.

To: **Michael, Graduate Coordinator Robin, Chenliang, Grad Student Association (ASE GSA)** </br>
From: **Sam Lerman**

Hi Michael,

I was excused from the one I missed in Fall, 2022, as is detailed below, and remediated it in Spring, 2023, on May, 5th. The one on May, 5th, I passed, with this condition from the committee members: I don't remember the exact phrasing, but "please provide a one-page chapter-list." Specifically, after my 20-minute presentation, and the 5-10 minute independent-room discussion that followed, I was informed of the following additional formal requirements not originally conveyed by the committee, separate from what they decided in the independent-room discussion (not having left early on purpose if I did):

(1) before June 5, 2023, provide a 1-page write up that addresses the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches of the thesis and give an outline of thesis chapters, </br>
(2) before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.

I sent them the chapter-list as well as a 6-page write-up containing the problem statement, hypothesis, and approaches (and made sure to cleanly summarize those parts on approximately a single page in that write-up), as documented on email also. In total, I sent a 6-page write-up instead of a 1-page write-up as well as the originally required chapter-list. This can't be stressed enough: I sent them more than what they asked, as committee member Chris Kanan stated on email record.

Chenliang told me I left the meeting early. I did not know I left the meeting early, as I told Chenliang, and I'm still not convinced I did, though the evidence for that is hard to argue given that I was sleep-deprived and Chenliang seems to think so. But, Tom Howard had just said "I just want to add, I think it's important," and thinking he meant my work, I did a sincere and prolonged "bless you" sign with my hands in the silence, before dropping the line. The meeting was scheduled for 30 minutes, on email-provable record, and this was both after the independent-room discussion and after the committee had laid out what I had to do next. And yes, I sincerely meant it. Chenliang's students can confirm I've done this in sincerity before, such as after having proposed the BittleBot project.

A six-month review, to remind you, is "an informal meeting meant to help the student." The grad school, not me, should be accountable for committee members and an advisor, and then a second advisor, leaving (especially with short, no, or again short notice).

My question is, since I felt your answer disingenuous: whether the second requirement ("before August 30, 2023, re-do and pass a six-month review.") was mentioned at any point at/between the time of termination and October 31st, by anyone other than me, since, suspiciously: I conveniently mentioned it for you in my grad department email of October 30th.

Regarding Henry's absence, Chenliang was aware from Fall semester into Spring semester that I had missed that six-month review, most likely understanding that: (1) six-month reviews are informal assessments meant to help the student, not live-or-die assessments on which termination can be suspiciously, ambiguously, and retroactively justified long after notice of termination — specifically, October 31st, my last day, following my grad department email on October 30th in which I reminded you that this make-up requirement existed, that chronologically followed after Chenliang's notice of stipend cut, and (2) Henry couldn't attend, which I was not notified of until last-minute — Chenliang, not Henry, notified me, last-minute, just at that six-month review time point, that my former advisor and active committee member was retiring and wouldn't be available. After I was excused — by my advisor, and as far as I could know department — I was not notified again until the Spring one with a new committee, *when, and **in advance of**, one other committee member had left* (Robbie Jacobs). 

Now, to remind you, I also suffered many induced and excruciatingly severe tragedies while I was employed and working as a student that the university did not yet address. 

However, for now, it would mean a lot to me if you could answer my question [yes/no, specify when, and provide a quotation as proof].

This was the question:

> Was this six-month review mentioned at/between the time of my termination and October 31st?

**Since you bring up the PhD student handbook**, here is a direct quote: "When withdrawing support, the faculty will indicate to the student, in writing, what is necessary for reinstatement of support” (Page 15). You must provide in writing that the make-up review was mentioned.

Here is what I was able to find, dated October, 12th: 

> I have conferred with members of your committee.  They confirm that the plan you outline is neither consistent with what you originally proposed for the PhD nor a viable path to completion of the degree.  With regret, we will be terminating your student status and stipend as of the end of October.

Let me elaborate on "the [research] plan you outline is [not] consistent [...] nor a viable path." These judgements had no grounds, with no writing specifying how those assertions were true, as was needed, presumably, for reinstatement — therefore, not satisfying the "what is necessary" requirement written in the PhD handbook. I ask this with all awareness of the context: does "innocent until proven guilty," in determining an employee's termination, hold at the University of Rochester? 

As for the question as to whether I was an employee, note that, by the way, for much of my first 3 years, my PhD funding was provided from clocking in through HRMS at the University of Rochester Medical Center, even serving under Chenliang for free while I did so. However, **as recently as the pre-Trump era**, depending on your definition: 

(1) "For tax purposes, the Internal Revenue Service considers the compensation of graduate student employees to be wages. When graduate students receive payment for teaching, it is not taxed on a 1042-S form (for scholarships), but on a W-2 (which is the form for employment income)." (Wikipedia, ["Graduate student employee unionization"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduate_student_employee_unionization#:~:text=For%20tax%20purposes%2C%20the%20Internal,the%20form%20for%20employment%20income)). </br>
(2) "Graduate Employee means a graduate student appointed at .20 FTE or greater to provide teaching-related duties, research, or administrative duties." (Law Insider, ["Graduate Employee definition"](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/graduate-employee)).

Furthermore, one of the three, excluding my advisor, committee members, on formal, written record, misremembered provable details about that meeting, such as

(1) how many times we met (he claimed twice rather than once), </br>
(2) and the duration (he claimed 1.5 hours rather than 30 minutes). 

**Since you bring up deadlines**, I was notified of my stipend being cut prior to the six-month review make-up deadline on August 30th, as Chenliang my advisor, the entire committee, and you yourself can confirm, by Chenliang's reply email.

Also, Michael, why does a six-month review make-up have so much weight when I had to report to two labs every action I took every week for the last 3 years?

There was no reply. Michael never answered any of my questions or addressed the things I asked to be addressed, or referred anyone else to address the things I asked to be addressed. Michael and the University of Rochester stayed silent on the whole of the matters conveyed in this repo, to date of writing. Below, in the Epilogue, I will disprove their own judgement using their own policy. But first, Credits.

# $\mathcal{Epilogue}$ (Conclusive disproof of Michael)

Resume dark tone:

## Reminder of context mentioned in [first disproof](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md)

Unlike here, the main [disproof](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/3-Disproof.md) continued without the suppositions described here about everything they claim being true. 

The PhD student handbook has one clause of accountability for the grad school, and it's to specify what the PhD student would need to do (without pay or support) for reinstatement.

The only time reinstatement was mentioned was by Michael. No details were given how, on what conditions, and whether any advisor or source of income would be provided, and if not, how to go about obtaining those without any further connections or resources to do so. Having emailed the individual faculty members who might have served as replacements, and met with one and suggested another to the department, there wasn't a path (and none of these things were suggested by the faculty in writing). Michael reached out to meet in person, but that would not be sufficient for reinstatement nor secure my future as an employee with a salary, advisor, and a basic standard of living. The reason for wanting to meet was "mutual understanding", not "what is necessary" for reinstatement, unless "mutual understanding" with Michael, someone who I don't know and never met, becomes a requirement for reinstatement, the chair of a department in an institution that tortured me in person for six years, during yet another trauma, this time being actively inflicted by him. 

Also, I replied to the email (while still officially a grad student) asking for evidence and my reply was ignored. It was the last message sent between us prior to these ones that I reinstated, also currently being ignored.

Additionally, I cannot endure more meetings and deliberations where I have to defend against their morally outrageous actions after this ump-teenth set of traumas (including ones I haven't mentioned in this repo that also happened during this time period, also are egregious, and also were induced by the Medical Center via coercion, ["#NotEnoughCarbs"](https://github.com/slerman12/BrokenWisdoms/blob/main/4-Faith.md) and more...) culminating six years of torture from this one institution.

It's taking me a year to write this. They couldn't even understand my research, and Michael isn't even in my field. Did he really expect me to convey all of this in a single meeting as well while I had no salary or income? I responded to Michael about that directly: (1) "Hi Michael, I’d be willing to meet. But please extend my stipend through November," and "I would be glad to meet in person, but I ask that you restore my stipend for the month of November. Thank you." (November is my birthday actually). I did my best to convey and elaborate on everything and he ignored those emails too. Meanwhile, I was being actively overseen remotely and in person by two different research groups requiring regular research updates, software engineering tasks, and progress reports — both of whom said I was done and ready to defend, and none of whom were Michael.

Furthermore, support was withdrawn long before Michael sent that email.

## Definitions

### (1) Necessity of support set.

Define the set of "what is necessary for reinstatement of support, indicated to the student by the faculty, in writing, when support is withdrawn" as the variable $x$.

$x$ $\coloneqq$ $\emptyset$.

That is the empty set, as described in the [context reminder](#reminder-of-context-mentioned-in-first-disproof). 

## Propositions

### (1) Truth.

Suppose every reason they had for terminating me was true. (False, but assume True).

### (2) Sufficient cause.

Suppose any one of them suffices. (False, but assume True).

### (3) Student's negligence.

Suppose I didn’t do anything they suggested or requested of me. (Extraordinarily False, but assume True).

&#9432; This is now the strongest set of possible assumptions I can make in their favor, because it assumes that everything they did was perfect and accurate up to and probably well beyond their claims.

Finally:

### (4) PhD student handbook.

“When withdrawing support, the faculty will indicate to the student, in writing, what is necessary for reinstatement of support.” - PhD student handbook, page 15. Mathematically:

$\vert x \vert > 0$.

## Disproofs

### (1) Proposition 4.

**Disproof.**

$x = \emptyset$. &nbsp; (Definition 1) 

$\rightarrow |x| = 0$ 

$\quad \quad \ \ \not> 0$. &nbsp; $\square$

## Disproof conclusion

- If they find this point too pedantic, then they should consider what it's like to endure six years of trauma and get terminated by their torturers for far less justification.
- They can't claim “just doing their jobs” as an excuse for these events, because they aren’t, even by their own policy, even when all of their claims are treated as steel by supposing: (1) every reason they had for terminating me was true, (2) any one of them suffices, and (3) I didn’t do anything they suggested or requested of me. That is, "steel-manning" them as opposed to ["straw-manning"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man).
- I wrote in the email, "Also, Michael, why does a six-month review make-up have so much weight when I had to report to two labs every action I took every week for the last 3 years?" Seems somewhat pedantic. But it's policy, of course, and therefore, going by the University of Rochester’s **wisdom**, policy is more important than human rights. Then this disproven one that's being **broken** by the University of Rochester right now, perhaps matters. But who knows, maybe the point of including it in the PhD student handbook was just to get me to write all of this. Maybe, somebody else would like to hear about my would-be thesis, had you and the committee not rejected and desecrated it. 5 - 7 years is the average time for a PhD. I was finishing my 6th year. All I asked for was a year in peace (and in reply to that you sent the termination letter). Though I can't say this year is going great, living with my mom and writing this, unemployed and sick with eczema and no salary or health insurance, and tons of student debt to pay off, I can say that my thesis plans won't be wasted. I wrote this. I'm writing more. And the disrespect you paid to me is your "teacher"'s debt. The mindset that led to the University of Rochester's policies and practices, across the medical, research, and learning centers, are militaristic, not healing or serving to the interests of human intelligence or whatever may exist out there, not consciously anyway. Unconsciously, that has yet to be determined. People are fueled by greed and motives that bias academic and medical goals, but I think we collectively want the world to be a better place. Perhaps this can play a large role in exposing something true about the depths of these institutions that others might not be aware of or haven't articulated. Perhaps my research can directly contribute to exposing some of the linguistic, neural, and physical hypotheses underlying a more literal consciousness in the collective sphere, political or metaphysical, curtail the unethical rise of AI consumerism, and actually teach people something.
