# Deus Ex Memory

This is an extraordinary email conversation with one of the newly added committee members Chris Kanan, who my advisor suggested last-minute as the replacement for one of the leaving former committee members.

Sam,

Your PhD committee met with you twice, and not for only 20 minutes as claimed. The first time was for your 6 month review, which lasted an hour, and it was the first time Prof. Howard and I had met you. You were unable or unwilling to answer many of our questions and your presentation did not follow the guidelines or instructions for 6 month reviews. I then endeavored to give you a lot of constructive advice via email with how you could address our concerns, which was not followed. We then met with you to discuss the next steps following your 6 month review, and upon hearing our feedback, you abruptly disconnected from Zoom after 20 minutes. Subsequently, the committee put together a set of requirements for retaking the 6 month review and to graduate, which seems to have been rejected by you. Committee members typically meet with students only on an as-needed basis which is initiated by the student.

Note that besides your advisor, your committee are all people who are volunteering their time. We have done our best to give you advice on how to graduate, but there is not much we can do if you reject all advice.

Chris

Chenliang, Tom, Charles — can you all confirm that Chris is mis-remembering? We only met once, in that first and only zoom meeting.

The 6 month review happened on May 5 from 1-2pm. It is possible I'm misremembering the second meeting as the second part of the 6-month review after you were brought back into the meeting, since I can't find it on my calendar. Regardless, it was definitely not for only 20 minutes.
