# Synchronicities in Presidential Elections

## Examples of a Plausible Universe-Endorsement

- Such as the bird that [landed on Bernie's podium](https://youtu.be/vhezYYiTUm0?si=qVq6vOENRU2YvN3C), early 2016.
  - ...or rather, right beside the podium. And then, as the crowd of 19,000 people cheered, and Bernie began, "Now you see, this little bird doesn't know it..." the bird flew up to his podium and landed there, an arm's length away, as Bernie looked honored and speechless.
- Such as the Bald Eagle (America's national bird) that [attacked Donald Trump](https://youtu.be/j1AU4qi7tWg?si=ItrWUDXTbLLN7Yw), 3.5 months before that.
- Such as Hillary Clinton being nominated over Bernie in 2016 and us being punished with a cartoon for a President for 4 years.
- Such as the [Shadow corporation blackout](https://youtu.be/9ljkWdXTx10?si=LXd_fXCDwyzQw2-i) when Pete Buttigieg barely [claimed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTnM870CCu8) above Bernie in the Iowa delegate vote (and [not the popular vote](https://youtu.be/swJW-bVc2es?si=pNYINRyCP4Yq0qu1)), February 3, 2020.
  - Specifically, the voting app that was used in Iowa, the first state to vote in the primaries, where polls [projected Bernie was going to win](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-primary-forecast/iowa/), had [“bad code,"](https://youtu.be/A7WzQRXwxos?si=tjnnnbyCtalch4g8) and was built by a company literally called Shadow [with financial ties to Pete Buttigieg's campaign](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/2609701/buttigieg-campaign-paid-firm-that-developed-voting-app-blamed-for-iowa-caucus-delays/). Ultimately, it was reported that Pete Buttigieg just barely won the delegate vote and Bernie Sanders won the popular vote. In my opinion, this was not orchestrated by Pete Buttigieg's campaign or the Democratic party (that would be too on the nose) and is therefore a synchronicity, or "statistically implausible coincidence."
- Such as the fact that it was [statistically unprecedented](https://youtu.be/SknqmOfXDSI?si=67VTmYjfVix-xepM) for somebody to win the popular vote in Iowa, New Hampshire, [*and Nevada*](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/02/22/nevada-caucuses-biden-sanders-116719), as Bernie did, and not become the party nominee.
- Such as Biden's [first comeback victory](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Carolina_Democratic_presidential_primary) over Bernie, and Biden's [first victory in a presidential primary ever](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_South_Carolina_Democratic_presidential_primary), marking the exact day (February 29, 2020) of the [first American to die from Covid according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/museum/timeline/covid19.html#:~:text=February%2029%2C%202020&text=CDC%20and%20the%20Washington%20Department,later%20died%20of%20his%20illness.). ["Biden celebrates a comeback victory in South Carolina’s Democratic primary, just as the U.S. reports what was believed to be the country’s first death from the coronavirus."](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/politics/pandemic-campaign-trump-biden/) - Washington Post. And while that wasn't the turning point for Biden's campaign yet, he did announce, ["We are very much alive"](https://youtu.be/UNqwH_3Hyds?si=A-oa2X_2TQSD4AiZ) at the onset of the first plague with respect to America.
- Such as the fact that every competitive candidate except Elizabeth Warren dropped out overnight last-minute and gave Biden the crucial victory [on Super Tuesday](https://youtu.be/K_NT-ViVR40?si=0U4AS3OEdpH9dIVe&t=257), March 3, 2020.
  - Right up until that last-second collusion[^1], Bernie was ahead [in every national poll](https://youtu.be/DHatG_lSI2U?si=1BztfIsqPxDunZHx) and [the betting markets](https://youtu.be/iqtxkVS17to?si=ZY6Bqs4Vq-xNWGQT), by wide margins, and [of course on policy preference as well](https://youtu.be/5MhaqVLoqHI?si=lUE0pH3FuUKViiWe), and [even in some of the expectations of the media](https://youtu.be/cohYnKrZ94U?si=QCRcKM4Z9f4fRLwg) ([even CNN](https://youtu.be/5AD3jKGlLjw?si=_nYcCDviPOuv08DD)).
  - ["Joe Biden just pulled off the biggest, fastest and most unexpected comeback in modern political history."](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/04/politics/joe-biden-super-tuesday-historic-comeback/index.html) - CNN. "There was simply no reason to think any of this was possible."
  - Each of the candidates most competitive to Joe Biden suddenly dropped out 2 days before the vote. However, Elizabeth Warren, whose voters might've transferred their votes to Bernie, stayed in. [70%](https://qr.ae/pszN6o) of the votes Elizabeth Warren (whose ideology is at least 70% closer to Bernie's than Biden's) received on Super Tuesday [would've been enough to give Bernie Sanders the Super Tuesday victory](https://medium.com/@damonjimmyhorn/what-if-elizabeth-warren-dropped-out-before-super-tuesday-a3a7769eee10) (and the California delegates also [ended up](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811814642/sanders-wins-california-largest-super-tuesday-prize-fueled-by-latino-vote) going to Bernie, meaning [no more than 66%](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/04/811814642/sanders-wins-california-largest-super-tuesday-prize-fueled-by-latino-vote) of her voters were needed to turn out for Bernie actually) and, [while an ideology-based transfer of votes wasn’t guaranteed](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/04/no-warren-didnt-rob-bernie-of-the-nomination.html), that principled outcome would've most likely secured him the Democratic nomination (conclusively and irreversibly in all likelihood, and then I think he [would've defeated Trump as well](https://youtu.be/7yMGyOU4yLI?si=xpD_TzHzk80FNvnp&t=58)).
- Such as a literal plague killing [thereafter](https://youtu.be/VzHaF30606k?si=nPbeiUarnT1oFpkI) more Americans than the American Revolution, Civil War, and WWII (including Pearl Harbor) combined[^2]. 
  - But [at least we got Biden](https://youtu.be/BhvdaK_HgbQ?si=yZ3obsrd423oIe61), and even while Trump was still sitting his final days in office ([March 27, 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CARES_Act#:~:text=The%20Coronavirus%20Aid%2C%20Relief%2C%20and,pandemic%20in%20the%20United%20States.) - January 20, 2021), his hand was forced by the pandemic to pass many far-left or Bernie-type policies, which continued with Biden as well:
    - Rapid [mass distribution of free medicine](https://youtu.be/T51a_7ljXnU?si=X0zRReRgZPKwkp4f).
    - [Giving everybody free money without means-testing](https://youtu.be/3869NqO8MUw?si=Hw-9jW-4wTxFSdCJ).
    - Adaptive labor conditions and stay-at-home working (just in time for the major advancements in automation that were discussed for the first time on a presidential primary debate pulpit [via Andrew Yang that election cycle](https://youtu.be/XbrDu8uWXCI?si=KcnZlTLXLHI4SERS)).
    - Thousands of poor Americans got bigger paychecks from the government than they'd ever seen in their lives (a kind of universal basic income happened under both Trump and Biden, [also proposed on that Democratic stage](https://youtu.be/j-pJzQJJiUs?si=rbCl_kUZdZSxuivk)).
    - Student debt repayment moratoria and, surprisingly, [cancellation](https://www.youtube.com/live/k2steBZ1JyE?si=v-YdO9nD8C3sGaOn) though [not to the extent that Bernie described in 2020](https://berniesanders.com/issues/free-college-cancel-debt/) nor [as Jill Stein in 2016](https://youtu.be/eKOdcxU6Clo?si=LQm7IFYPt4VPlssZ), with emails of confirmation delivered to recipients confirming their approval for the oncoming cancellation (I myself received one, confirming $20,000 of debt forgiveness), that the Supreme Court, surprisingly, overturned ([beyond the Supreme Court's authority](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/justice-kagan-calls-student-loan-decision-overreach-blows-constitution-rcna92044), at least going by ["a strict textual interpretation of the law"](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/03/will-the-supreme-court-overturn-student-debt-relief-forgiveness-cancellation-biden.html)). Notably, student debt cancellation (not just free college) was pretty radical even as recently as 2016 (same with $15 minimum wage, which [Bernie made mainstream in 2016](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/bernie-sanders-minimum-wage-party-platform-225325), [amid Democratic party opposition](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/opinion/hillary-clinton-should-just-say-yes-to-a-15-minimum-wage.html&ved=2ahUKEwi8qvae3_qGAxUJEVkFHQ_sDlAQFnoECBYQAQ&usg=AOvVaw00DW8oLmECgIVRgyvgkTMm), now ubiquitously [being implemented in a third of the US](https://www.hourly.io/post/minimum-wage-by-state#:~:text=Which%20States%20Have%20a%20%2415,%2415%20per%20hour%20or%20above.&text=While%20not%20a%20state%2C%20Washington,wage%20of%20%2417%20per%20hour.)).
    - Defining what "essential work" means, before the recent advances in AI and robotics, regarding which, Bernie is still (in 2024) acting like the most presidential leader of the 2020 frontrunners (despite *potentially* having no real political incentive to do so), even now, having recently written the [32-hour work week (with-no-loss-in-pay) bill](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf), which Congress [will be voting on](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1332/all-info) and which could (or rather, [by all reason should](https://youtu.be/PjJexW556Bw?si=ZgJwL2RG9m2BgEt6)) plausibly pass by 2032. The 40-hour work week was passed [in 1940](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf).
    - Not to mention [a large reduction in carbon pollution](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/emission-reductions-from-pandemic-had-unexpected-effects-on-atmosphere) [due to the pandemic, especially from automobile traffic and industry](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/1.GCP_.pdf), and Bernie's recent [Solar for All bill that passed](https://youtu.be/8hi-JpwoLi4?si=plTrjIPQ1Iuk_-SO).
- Such as the beyond ["unprecedentedness" of Bernie Sanders](https://qr.ae/psqdok) overall, including that he's a Jewish Democratic Socialist who has been [grass-roots funded](https://youtu.be/MHJIzkKLqkM?si=-P-S1n0LnNezVQDv) his entire political career, [breaking all funding records](https://youtu.be/akYmB9ZX8ps?si=11YIwObmXBxvtTU_), and his [authenticity](https://youtu.be/aOOfwN0iYxM?si=FpuCvykgHMS0hogI), [principles](https://youtu.be/PFdgmm69BpI?si=bkI9lNUk9KIN_tQZ), [consistency](https://youtu.be/JXo5fe7dYWk?si=bNmvmgcMpLBdp6Yl), and [hard work](https://www.newyorker.com/news/amy-davidson/bernie-sanderss-hard-fight-for-hillary-clinton); and he [doesn't take his success for granted](https://youtu.be/iRMICNBXp2Q?si=k4Ew6j8J5yR9j2ti). In the 2020 campaign (when he was 77), he was considered by the media as [too old](https://youtu.be/1RXSYhGJ9yw?si=qu6jWB_DaL-Y6Tal) (a criticism that should never be made of him again), even as he was working [harder](https://youtu.be/1a2gqS-W8Tg?si=djEUfiuGBcOgAgi0&t=23) than any other candidate on the campaign trail, [as he was](https://youtu.be/_om-x323Em0?si=GFUvAEn5YUCGtjQ0) (and [still is](https://youtu.be/O0fYQkQBOGc?si=QJ_c7Xyljn8ZFt5d&t=112)) off the campaign trail.
  - Donald Trump is sort of also unprecedented, but his case is different, as Nature also seems to use synchronicities to make fun of us and create farces. For example, speaking of age, out of 341.8 million Americans, our current top leading representatives in the running for the presidency as of June 28, 2024 are [an 81 year-old man undergoing cognitive decline](https://youtu.be/CAyBNzxxj2E?si=MnB8yjb889MRAUet) and [a 78 year-old charged felon](https://youtu.be/fSNMSTkeLcA?si=EMGGOK3IO7-GE15D). In contrast to Bernie's still [holding](https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/explore/public_figure/Bernie_Sanders) the [highest popularity of any politician in office and one of the highest of any living politicians generally](https://youtu.be/dUP-3wJ_U8s?si=5C07o_sMeIw3bAWy), both Biden and Trump are [historically unpopular](https://www.facebook.com/share/v/3wocxpkQo3nrKNcK/), in what ABC News calls ["historically unusual."](https://abcnews.go.com/538/americans-hated-candidates-biden-trump/story?id=108655435) Hindsight this time around really is 2020. But there's something else to say about Donald Trump regarding his criminality and conviction: he obeyed some laws of consciousness-physics more than other politicians and that gave Republicans their own image-apparent to Bernie Sanders. Perhaps the shared timing of two populist figures rising on both the left and the right had to do with more than just some of the shared-underlying-ordinary-causal-factors [that explain Bernie's rise](https://youtu.be/Gk_gWWar7hs?si=s66d-m7ERSQ89nqq) [and some of Trump's rise, and the scapegoating that explains Trump's rise](https://youtu.be/Gk_gWWar7hs?si=s66d-m7ERSQ89nqq), but also perhaps something not-causal-by-modern-physics-and/or-consciousness-knowledge.
    - It perhaps also highlights the poetic but distinguishing symmetry between the two populists that ["Medicare for All"](https://youtu.be/OrQXhYcYKHc?si=Z_Rh0j8nao5fL5o7) and ["Build a wall,"](https://youtu.be/Iuc5bTfAY6U?si=S986vdZn2hVS8OWH) the policy cornerstones of each respectively, linguistically rhyme. Though different in root and semantic substance, their individual spoken word [phonetic](https://qr.ae/ps363n) and [linguistic](https://www.vox.com/2016/2/18/11046650/bernie-sanders-accent) similarity is another way Trump may have appeared like an image-apparent of Bernie to Republicans. However, the fact that the cornerstone of Bernie's platform just before the plague was about universal healthcare, paid for by billionaires, with Trump being the epitome of [tax-avoiding](https://theconversation.com/is-donald-trumps-tax-avoidance-ethical-or-honorable-4-essential-reads-196979) billionaires, is also synchronistic.
    - Updates, as of July 14, 2024, fresh off the printing press: [Gunshots fired at Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania](https://youtu.be/QmmrgVoFq14?si=2WD-d_K56lE6J9NY). I guess “the butler did it” would’ve been too cliche for the universe’s writing. Written in Pennsylvania, which has “pen” and “pencil” and “vain” in the name. In the background of the gunshot firing, his supporters are holding up signs that say, “You’re fired,” the worst possible slogan to glorify. Trump had a show called Celebrity Apprentice where the catchphrase was [“You’re fired,”](https://youtu.be/CHzdxly0Y9Q?si=Kj0h1t6LRes2Zqs1) a former president who served during the unemployment crisis of the pandemic, [whose tax law incentivized corporate outsourcing](https://itep.org/trump-gop-tax-law-encourages-companies-to-move-jobs-offshore-and-new-tax-cuts-wont-change-that/), and [who additionally awarded rather than punished the outsourcing of 200,000 jobs](https://www.commondreams.org/news/2020/10/05/promises-made-workers-betrayed-trump-gave-425-billion-federal-contracts-corporations). His secret service tackled him and he got up with a bloody ear, perhaps due to the gunshot, and struck a defiant pose. The fist pump with bloody right ear was pretty cool. The universe would probably like to cut off Trump's (politically)-right ear. Also this gunshot happened not long after Trump made some comment about [assassinating Liz Cheney](https://youtu.be/35LnKuKUpk8?si=HbjQYxCuSkEX0M58). The farce is pretty much whichever one of them (Trump or Biden, [the latter of whom the media has only recently realized is in cognitive decline](https://www.youtube.com/live/-v-8wJkmwBY?si=l-so_Zq19ZYsGl7C)) wins, and the fact that a charged felon now looks like the cooler choice than the sitting president. It’s ironic the signs say “You’re fired Joe Biden” when Joe Biden is currently the sitting president and Trump is literally the fired one, both as president in the sense of losing his 2020 incumbent reelection bid and literally his ear in the sense of a gunshot. Meanwhile, [Biden has said he might be willing to drop out if "the Lord almighty" told him to](https://youtu.be/yz5uySyOKQ0?si=fgoMFeMQp43c6aTj), which clearly hasn't happened since that would ruin the farce, by making it a more complicated, less obvious farce. Biden also [might've confessed](https://youtu.be/zDuF_O2pI2Y?si=FF2xt9JlhwZph_MR) at the debate with Trump how his campaign [beat Medicare](https://youtu.be/ej4gFT21VOM?si=Nb-l6UgTAWEFQHA0) for All, Bernie's cornerstone policy, in 2020.
      - The assailant, [Thomas Matthew  "Crooks"](https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/gunman-who-tried-to-assassinate-former-us-president-donald-trump-identified/article68402698.ece), who is alleged to have done the shooting, injuring Trump's right ear, however, is quite a nuanced point. At first glance, it would appear that "crooks" are opposed to Trump, that Trump's and the right's enemies are the crooks, by this symbolism. And that might be true to a nuanced extent, because Democrats and Republicans alike are funded by Wall Street and other crooks. This is an important warning, and not the first time such a warning about the dual nature of the crooks (existing in both parties) has been delivered. The first time I heard [the phrasing "crooks of Wall Street"](https://youtu.be/7UrXK7OBBOo?si=7143YBNgWqEmvBw9) was from Bernie Sanders and is something he's been warning Americans about his entire career. Wall Street heavily backed Hillary Clinton's campaign, both [against Bernie Sanders](https://youtu.be/k_8jaYYdWuc?si=g9ZnBT4rthTsXint) and again later [against Trump](https://youtu.be/T2z8App14bs?si=CO4rZzU8hUEpW7xl). She even called half of Trump's supporters (including the far right) a ["basket of deplorables"](https://youtu.be/PCHJVE9trSM?si=x5a7U4D7AC2HD_o0). The nuanced warning is this, if this symbolism is to be interpreted: the enemy of the enemy in this case, might not be a friend.
    - Updates, as of July 21, 2024: Biden drops out and Kamala Harris, who also ran against Bernie in 2020 and dropped out and endorsed Biden prior to Super Tuesday as well, is on track to be [coronated via selection by state delegates](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/23/opinion/kamala-harris-democrats.html) as the Democratic nominee.
      - Another synchronicity is that, of either party, the party of democracy is the one that is on track to skip a democratic vote, wherein 50% of the American presidential election choice will be decided by that party’s leaders, and the other 50% has already been nominated as Trump, leaving Democrats with effectively no voice in both the primary and presidential selection.
        - This is now more complicated than an old man undergoing cognitive decline vs. a charged felon. The Democratic party, the party whose motto for the last 4 years has been ["democracy is on the line"](https://youtu.be/1oLASyBldIw?si=wXYSuUidmmYsHchB), is on track to nominate somebody without a democratic vote, due to increasing pressure from a disillusioned media and [political elite](https://youtu.be/8NcVFwMKUDw?si=F7WZWvxYTgUM-lJO) about Biden's cognitive decline and electoral chances. The replacement choice has never won a state in a presidential primary election, and is [also lagging behind Trump in the polls](https://youtu.be/J3iCS39SVYE?si=TZ9wCVOuwKQAXJ-3). The polls [have since improved](https://youtu.be/GohkbcaEQRg?si=sRvD-wue2xjYcJBh).
          - Now it’s [“Top Cop”](https://www.statesman.com/story/news/state/2024/08/09/kamala-harris-attorney-general-california-top-cop-law-enforcement-officer/74509793007/) (Kamala Harris was a prosecutor) vs. robber (Donald Trump is a charged felon), where the more [ACAB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAB) side is pro-cop and the more anti-ACAB side is pro-robber. 
      - And yet a bigger set of synchronicities: In 1968, Robert F. Kennedy (father of RFK Jr., who [ran earlier in this election cycle](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/democrats-mobilize-stop-rfk-jr-cutting-biden-rcna145952)) won across the 13 primary states and was assassinated (assassinations like that aren't exactly common, nor the recent historical assassination attempt on Trump that grazed his ear). Then, not long after, in the same year (1968), Vice President Hubert Humphrey was nominated by the party, though the primary elections were over and he hadn't won a singe state. Following that, the perception of him being pro-Vietnam ([analogous](https://youtu.be/6Ei-M9JVTg8?si=iqy3Fv57Hlph2p4d) to [the Biden-Kamala stance on the ongoing war between Israel and Gaza](https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/22/harris-may-not-be-the-savior-on-gaza-some-dems-want-00170420)), amid a Cold War ([analogous](https://www.thenation.com/article/world/ukraine-us-russia-gorbachev/) with ongoing [Cold War-type tensions with Russia](https://www.historians.org/teaching-learning/current-events-in-historical-context/ukraine-russia-conflict/)), amid [protests by young college students](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1968_Democratic_National_Convention_protests) (having [repeated on a large scale around the war between Israel and Gaza recently](https://youtu.be/DM1SPHTsdyY?si=qbZ6q_PKF9HN5wmK)), combined with the perception of him being a vice president that was undemocratically coronated ([“against Humphrey’s winning the nomination without entering a single primary”](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey) just like Kamala is on track to be), were [at least some of the main factors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Humphrey) that resulted in him losing the presidential election, and Richard Nixon (who’s [analogous](https://youtu.be/52Ex7Ttj5bo?si=95R-cNBB6vMbk1Mf) to Trump in some ways) winning the presidential election. That was the last time anything like this happened — almost. Nixon had to resign in his 2nd term, and his replacement was then decided based on the 25th amendment, also somewhat undemocratically. Since 1968, the Democratic primary elections have been reformed in many ways, including the Democratic party extending voting access from 13 states to 50 states.
        - That's a lot of sychronicities for 1968.  
        - Worth noting that Bernie might ["accept your nomination!"](https://youtu.be/0ti98bgCNT0?si=w2dx4r8T6OHx2rAQ&t=47) given the choice, in case Nixon's victory was any warning.
        - Meanwhile, Bernie [literally looks like he’s getting younger](https://youtu.be/qx5f0wvZvqg?si=xI8huz2acjddy-m_) and is [actively not dividing Democrats up](https://youtu.be/Qo4dMSGKnag?si=6dfk-1CkSW5MXflo), as he's [doing a great job of communicating the merits of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris](https://youtu.be/9x8zSQVkVmc?si=YXzs6sPJuE_JmiTA), [and fighting un-hypocritically for the principles of democracy](https://youtu.be/PIDrUmE_zmk?si=gBFA1ezd9egDLU4u).
  - The Great Depression lasted from 3 terms of bad Republican leadership (Harding, Republican, 1921 - 1923; Coolidge, Republican, 1923 - 1929; Hoover, Republican, 1929 - 1933), due to wealth inequality, corruption, Wall Street, banks, and [a mass redistribution of wealth to the top 1%](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/its-been-almost-a-100-years-since-the-americas-1-had-so-much-wealth-2019-02-11). Those 3 terms were the Great Depression (causally, though the correlation dates are slightly shifted forward), followed by alleviation when Franklin D. Roosevelt took into office (and who stayed in office until his death at the beginning of his 4th term). These 3 terms, 2016-2028 (perhaps truncated), are the Great Political Farce, and I think 2028 - at least 2032, should be the term(s) of President Bernie Sanders, when Bernie Sanders takes into office. And perhaps he can have approximately 4 terms.
    - Bernie was born a year before Biden, both were born during President Franklin D. Roosevelt's 3rd term, though Bernie is several decades younger in cognitive health and works harder based on the bills that [he writes](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/1655?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22Medicare+for+all+Act%22%7D&s=1&r=1), [Congressional speeches](https://youtu.be/3_M7XOiguuw?si=mkbO3Dzxl1iTZpwM) he gives, and his public [appearances](https://youtu.be/WpgkxRd6_44?si=omKQOGYMOKDgt4tD) and [programs](https://youtu.be/qE5BWFRETdk?si=j6k7pSfxOXTnbk8I). Despite [championing the 32-hour work week (without loss in pay)](https://youtu.be/SodvuR7KBEY?si=hjevImjh5P9IEJjs) in his [new bill](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf), Bernie most likely works well over the standard 40-hour work week.
    - In 2032, the [32-hour work week](https://www.sanders.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/32-Hour-Workweek-Act_Fact-Sheet_FINAL.pdf) should pass because the 40-hour work week passed in 1940, at the end of Franklin D. Roosevelt's 2nd term by the way, a year before Bernie was born. This isn't a prediction; it's a small example of something we can collectively do consciously to tell a long-form story: purposeful man-designed synchronicity, [and a reduced work week (without loss in pay) is a good idea](https://youtu.be/PjJexW556Bw?si=ZgJwL2RG9m2BgEt6), especially in the dawning age of AI automation and robotics[^3]. This kind of man-designed synchronicity is distinct from, for example, every race in Germany being made to be Aryan — blond-haired and blue-eyed — or for every official in Germany to dress in Nazi garb. The word "fascism" seems like a synchronicity to me in itself. Because while the far-right has been known to optimize a certain kind of "art" (e.g., the uniforms of the Nazi officials, all a single fashion), I think the left can actually tell beautiful stories (e.g., ["Birdie Sanders"](https://youtu.be/vhezYYiTUm0?si=qVq6vOENRU2YvN3C)), and govern in a way that actually creates art — beauty, good, not just superficial fashion — in the world. Franklin D. Roosevelt was the president who led America in defeating the Nazis, also in those 2nd, 3rd, and 4th terms. Imagine telling a policy-centric synchronistic story about Trump. You couldn't, it would devolve into sensationalism and celebrity, or villainizing this person or that (and there wouldn't be any particularly romantic synchronicities). This short essay is an example of a policy-centric long-form story in national governance, but the hero, especially when refactored in that way with synchronicities (and this is only mostly considering an 8-year period, 2016 - now, not even the rest of [his life](https://youtu.be/FynNrU76dto?si=KGE-_KRYRRrkQAuP) or all of his [track record](https://youtu.be/1Du9KdlmUrQ?si=TaufeX0hJqPPfe-X)), is Bernie.


Okay that’s all. 

## Meaning

No wait:

I think Nature’s meaning changes from symbol to symbol, depending on what the goal and conveyed message is. There are no strict rules “this means good”, “this means bad.” Nature achieves what Nature intends (with a big footnote answering [perhaps why suffering happens](https://github.com/animal-tree/Writing-stuff-2/blob/main/Theories/Cosmogenesis-Myth-2.md)). But interpreting that message requires intelligence and wisdom.

For example, I’m someone who once had a traumatic experience involving bugs. Don’t call me bug-man, but I vowed at the end of it “Every living thing” for who I serve (or at least that’s what I meant when I was tripping on mushrooms — don’t hold me to anything).

Anyway, if a bug appeared in my apartment, I would interpret it as Nature saying, I just debugged something. 

Or I might interpret it as someone who sees bugs and thinks they’re terrible omens. It differs. It depends on what I want and what makes sense. 

## Political Manipulation via Manufactured Signs

But like, one more thing: 

In the process of explaining them, my mind sort of has found too many patterns, especially in language, for comfort, sometimes! So pattern discernment is pretty important at the risk of going insane or, “exploited” is a relevant word. With coincidences if people really read into signs, their voting opinions and stuff like that could be manipulated by bad actors.

Be wary, because when this nature of the universe is proved, politicians will exploit it.

They \*might\*, I should say — they plausibly might use manufactured “signs” to sway voters. Manufactured synchronicity for manipulation.

In order to emulate/synthesize Nature's Word.

This can only come from humans, I think.

For companies with much of their workforce automated, I would extend that allowance perhaps even to users of that tech company's products, seeing as most people don't want the world's robots to be controlled entirely by whichever major tech directors happen to undemocratically own said robots, the existential threat of which is backed by recent [military](https://www.politico.eu/article/robots-coming-ukraine-testing-ground-ai-artificial-intelligence-powered-combat-war-russia/) and [surveillance](https://bigdatachina.csis.org/the-ai-surveillance-symbiosis-in-china/#:~:text=With%20regard%20to%20China%2C%20it,data%20acquired%20through%20government%20contracts.) events and the more economic threat is the monopolization of those technologies that will potentially dictate much of the functioning of our future society. The nuance of the endorsement (herein all of these synchronicities), however, suggests something more than just Andrew Yang (who I like), a vision of a future that is more idealistic, and with a long-running memory, not just pragmatic.
