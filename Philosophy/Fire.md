The idea of saying "everything is one" is counterintuitive to most people.

It’s like saying "fire is water."

Therefore, below we will more or less prove that fire is water. Fire, actually, is water.

For fun. Let’s begin.

Fire is a result of compounds breaking in such a way that their fragments bond with oxygen in the air and their rupture releases a hailstorm of accelerative electrons and photons, shooting into the air like knives, triggering a chain reaction of more such compounds breaking up.

Those compounds are called hydrocarbons, in the case of, for example, wood. Wood is hydrocarbons. Hydrogen and carbon. Paired together in holy divorcable matrimony.

Now when you rub them together hard and long enough with enough friction, you can rupture those bonds! After all, they’re held together quite precariously by gravity and electromagnetism and all of that. Squeeze ‘em hard enough and they more-or-less split.

So you rub two sticks together, say, using the [bow-drill method](https://youtu.be/_tpBCflcekU?si=XjzJAv3v1z3UOYJF) for fire making, and you rupture those hydrocarbons into hydrogens and carbons. Now the hydrogen will bond with the oxygen that is in the air (if you’re lucky), and the carbon will bond with the oxygen that is in the air  (if you’re unlucky), and this all-around combo-reconfiguration-of-bonding<sup>TM</sup> tends to leave excess energy that shoots off like knives into your eyes (or rather specific colors of light emitted by those accelerated/reconfigured electrons) — and also potentially into other atoms and hydrocarbons. So now that emission is what you see. It’s a spark!

If enough hydrocarbons are hanging around, say you put the ember in some tinder, now those little hailstorms will trigger a chain reaction. Like knives, they’ll cut through the other hydrocarbons present, creating instability — and more shooting photons and accelerating/re-configuring electrons. 

Meanwhile, those broken off hydrogens bonded to oxygen — you know what they are? Water! Water vapor technically. Steam, if you like, with its composition of oxygen and hydrogen amidst a hailstorm of photons and electrons. That "electricity water" is fire. 

Now the carbons on the other hand can also bond with oxygen. And that creates CO2. Meanwhile, some non-combustible elements in the mix (since non-charcoal wood for example is composed combustibly of more than just hydrocarbons) create the resultant ash and, its rising form, lifted by those gasses and water rising, smoke. 

(But does that mean fire is also CO2? Depending on the composition, maybe, though [very much](https://www.osha.gov/green-jobs/hydrogen/fire-explosion#:~:text=Hydrogen%20used%20in%20the%20fuel,a%20leak%20can%20be%20detected.) [not necessarily](https://www.quora.com/Can-you-burn-something-without-producing-CO2) and [varies](https://theconversation.com/curious-kids-if-steam-contains-water-what-does-smoke-from-fire-contain-172505))

"Electriquey steam with some residue" — FIRE — in 5 words.

So fire is water? Yes, reconfigured-electron (let's call it "electriquey") water (electrons accelerating the way they do within, or across, or out of, water atoms). It is possible. It’s water with some electrons creating a photoelectric rainbow of red and blue and yellow in your survival-expert-tool-wielding human eyes.

If water with a neutron added is called ["heavy water,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_water) why isn't gaseous water with some reconfiguring electrons (the excess energy of which causes light to be emitted) a kind of water, with [or without](https://www.osha.gov/green-jobs/hydrogen/fire-explosion#:~:text=Hydrogen%20used%20in%20the%20fuel,a%20leak%20can%20be%20detected.) CO2 in the mix?

That’s fire! Or maybe the whole sum is fire, and "heavy water" should be renamed something else and only something else.

Disclaimer: this is meant to be educational comedy.

It still reads like tragedy.

> Well, there are other kinds of fires, e.g., magnesium fires, that don't need water at all.

"Fire is usually water." Especially in the majority of human existence and in particular on Earth.

> But here's an argument for why the definition of fire should be narrowed down to the primal one and those other fires should be called combustion: The definition is already narrowed down from fission, which like the shooting knives of fire, breaks apart neighbors through chain reactions facilitated by neutrons rather than photons, and from the acceleration of nuclei rather than electrons. If modifying water with a neutron doesn't change the "heavy water" from being water, then modifying photons with neutrons, and electrons with nuclei might not change "fission" from being fire. But it does. So we can narrow down that definition further in such a way as to respect primal ancestors, while still appreciating magnesium combustion, manufactured combustion, industrial combustion as combustion, to remember the sacredness of our roots as a species, and the first technology we ever invented and evolved with. Millions of years with one type of fire, and you want to equate it to magnesium and candle wax? 

Note: This is already independent from the conclusion that "Fire is usually water, especially in the majority of human existence and in particular on Earth."

> Yes, but the Garden of Eden wants its fire back.

"Yes, and I'm Saruman, building my Urak-hai army with 'false' fires," Webster dictionary says snobbishly, thinking it's being sarcastic.

[All the armies of Rohan and the Ents rally to defeat Isengard].

"Wait, but why would Ents care about respecting fires as burning hydrocarbons, if they're made of hydrocarbons?" asks Merry about the Ents, the ancient living trees that can walk and talk.

"Because," the Ent begins, slowly. "It was the ancients who took our branches, sometimes our bodies, yes. But Saruman has destroyed all the forests. The ancients held sacred the Ents, rarely chose Ent over tree for their fire. Those trees that they burned left carbon for Ents to breathe, not from Ent bark. But Saruman, has forsaken the Ents. He doesn't see hydrocarbon from Ent. He burns all."

> "Got it," Saruman says. "Hydrocarbon is not Ent." And he proceeds with his burning.
